    "# 15. Decorator in Python\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Decorator provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions.__\n",
    " * __By definition, a decorator is a function that takes antoher funciton and extends their behaviour of the latter function without explictily modifying it.__\n",
    " * __A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function as it's argument, and return yet another fucntions.__\n",
    " * __Decorators can extremely useful as they allow the extension of existing functions, withyout any modifications to the original fucntion source code.__\n",
    " * __In fact, there are two types of decorators in Python including class decorators and function decorators.__\n",
    " * __In application, decorators are majorly used in creating middle layer in the backend, it perform taks like toekn authentication, validation, image compression.__"
